					<h3>Education</h3>

					<h3>Work</h3>
					<p>
						Since January of 2015, I have been working for Grand Valley State University's Institutional Marketing department. I am a student worker on their web team. It is through this job that I learned more about web development and gained my interest in making my own website. I have an interest in mobile development as well. After graduating, I wouldn't mind looking for an entry level position doing mobile development. There is also an internship opportunity this summer doing mobile development in downtown Grand Rapids.

					<h3>Brotherhood</h3>
					<p>
						In the fall of 2015, I decided to rush a fraternity. On November 20, 2015, I became a brother of the Delta Phi chaper of Alpha Sigma Phi fraternity. This was one of the best decisions I ever made. I joined an amazing group of men, who I am proud to call my brothers. We are working hard to raise money for our philanthropy, Canine Companions for Independence (CCI). You can learn more about CCI and everything they do at <a href="cci.org" target="_blank">CCI.org</a>.
					</p>

					<p>
						Our biggest way to raise money for CCI is our annual BikeTrip. BikeTrip is an 8 day trip where the brothers who have raised at least a certain amount of money for CCI bike the perimeter of Lake Michigan. Churches and schools graciously donate their facilities for us to rest overnight in along the way. When we make it to Chicago, we deliver the check of everything we raised to CCI. If you would like to make a donation to CCI and the puppies, you can do so <a href="http://www.cci.org/faf/donorReg/donorPledge.asp?ievent=1148099&supId=427943917" target="_blank">here</a>.

					<h3>Marching Band</h3>
					<p>
						I have played clarinet in the Laker Marching Band ever since I entered Grand Valley as a freshman. My junior year, I became even more involed with the band. I became a section for the clarinet section, I headed the uniform committee on the Laker Marching Band Council, and I managed the marching band's website. You can check out videos of the Laker Marching Band's seasons <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/LakerMarchingBand" target="_blank">here</a>.

					<h3>Hobbies / Interests</h3>
					<p>
						My interests include Broadway plays, <em>Lord of the Rings</em>, and special effects/film editing. <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> is by far my favorite book/movie series. I even collect the replica weaponry from the movies. As for special effects, I like to play around with the software, HitFilm. I am currently running HitFilm 4 Pro, and although I don't do much filming, I do enjoy working with the software whenever I get the chance. If you wish to learn more about HitFilm, visit their website at <a href="hitfilm.com" target="_blank">hitfilm.com</a>.

					<h3>Projects</h3>

						I'm hoping to post some of my coding projects on this site in the furture. There are several coding projects for school this semester that would be nice to put up here. I might also post some of my special effect projects here.
