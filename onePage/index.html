					<h3>Work</h3>

					<h3>Hobbies / Interests</h3>
					<p>
						My interests include Broadway plays, <em>Lord of the Rings</em>, and special effects/film editing. <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> is by far my favorite book/movie series. I even collect the replica weaponry from the movies. As for special effects, I like to play around with the software, HitFilm. I am currently running HitFilm 4 Pro, and although I don't do much filming, I do enjoy working with the software whenever I get the chance. If you wish to learn more about HitFilm, visit their website at <a href="hitfilm.com" target="_blank">hitfilm.com</a>.

					<h3>Brotherhood</h3>
					<p>
						In the Fall of 2015, I decided to rush a fraternity. On November 20, 2015, I became a brother of the Delta Phi chaper of Alpha Sigma Phi fraternity. This was one of the best decisions I ever made. I joined an amazing group of men, who I am proud to call my brothers. We are working hard to raise money for our philanthropy, Canine Companions for Independence (CCI). You can learn more about CCI and everything they do at <a href="cci.org" target="_blank">CCI.org</a>.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						Our biggest way to raise money for CCI is our annual BikeTrip. BikeTrip is an 8 day trip where the brothers who have raised at least a certain amount of money for CCI bike the perimeter of Lake Michigan. Churches and schools graciously donate their facilities for us to rest overnight in along the way. When we make it to Chicago, we deliver the check of everything we raised to CCI. Bike Trip officially began in the spring of 1996 with just a handful of brothers. They took off from the Clock-tower on campus in Allendale and circumnavigated Lake Michigan on a self-sustained bicycle ride in about 2 weeks. That year, from what we understand, they raised a total of about $1,000. Paying out of pocket for any bicycle repairs, parts, food and other expenses, they got by with what they had and camped as they made their way around the lake. Today, we are much larger in size, more advanced with our bicycle technologies, and live a more luxurious life in vans, which follow the riders around the lake for safety reasons. If you would like to make a donation to CCI and the puppies, you can do so <a href="http://www.cci.org/faf/donorReg/donorPledge.asp?ievent=1148099&supId=427943917" target="_blank">here</a>.
